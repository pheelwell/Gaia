The servants of the cold sun are a group based in Gundras which praise Drinera and live life in her philosophy. 

They keep the holy distance when they wear their masks. They wear a mask which represent the face of Drinera. A face of ice and Solitude. They operate together but keep distance to each other. They have codenames, given by Drinera.
