Tiebel ist ein kleines Dorf am Rande einer riesigen Gebirsformation, der Klingenwand.
Das Dorf befindet sich direkt vor einer großen Höhle dieses Gebirges. In Tiebel wird viel Bergbau betrieben und dafür eignet sich diese Höhle.
Das Dorf beherbergt nicht viele Bewohner, hier wohnen hauptsächlich Bergarbeiter. Es gibt die wichtigsten Geschäfte wie einen Gemischthandel, einen Schmied und ein kleines Gasthaus.
Zu dem steht auf einer kleinen Erhöhung aber direkt am Rande (nicht ausserhalb oder gesondert) ein kleiner Turm, dieser dient als Forschungszentrum für ausgewählte Schüler von Ravenfall und ist das Zuhause des Großmagiers Retuzan.
