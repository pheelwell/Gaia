## Rules and Axioms
- Gods Always come in Twins, that embody Opposites.
- Gods are not outright at War, but have a peace Treaty and can't directly hurt each other.
- Gods Live in a Demi plane and cant enter the real World.
- The Divinity can only be channeled through the worshippers.
- Each God has a own Realm in the Divine Plane where his Minions reside.
- The Gods themself reside on the Center of the Demiplane where a moon and a sun orbit around themself
- They have a "Olympus" like home where they reside with other Gods but they can also visit other  home Realms.
- The creation of the universe was a result of the perfect balance between the twin gods, with one representing creation and the other representing destruction.
- The twin gods are constantly in a state of equilibrium, with their respective powers canceling each other out, thus maintaining a stable universe. As they collided they split into the now know Gods.
- Each god has an army of divine beings or celestial creatures that serve them and follow their command. These beings often act as intermediaries between the gods and their worshippers.
- The worshippers of these gods are vital to maintaining this cosmic balance. As they pray, perform rituals or offer sacrifices, they channel divine energy into the world, which strengthens their god's influence in the real world.
- The twin gods cannot directly interfere with mortal affairs but can grant boons or blessings to their followers. These can manifest in various ways, such as granting supernatural abilities or providing assistance during difficult times.
- While these twin gods have differing ideologies and goals, they understand that their coexistence is essential for maintaining universal harmony. They occasionally collaborate to achieve common objectives or to maintain cosmic order.
- Worshipers of both gods often exist within societies side by side. While some may view followers of the opposing deity as rivals or enemies, others may recognize that both deities play an important role in sustaining life and existence.
- Each realm within the divine plane has unique characteristics based on its governing deity. For example, a realm ruled by a god of war might be dominated by vast battlefields and fortresses while one belonging to a goddess of nature could be filled with lush forests and vibrant ecosystems.
- At times when cosmic balance is threatened (perhaps due to an overabundance of power being channeled towards one god), divine beings from both factions may be sent to intervene by influencing events in the mortal world or combating otherworldly threats.
