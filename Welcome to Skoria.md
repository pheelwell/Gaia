Greetings, intrepid scholar,

You have crossed the threshold into the hallowed halls of the Great Vault Library, the grand repository of all knowledge pertaining to the enigmatic realm of [[Skoria]]. Here, amidst the silence punctuated by the soft rustle of ancient pages, I—your devoted arcane librarian—shall serve as your guide through the chronicles and arcana that have been meticulously preserved within these walls.

Prepare your mind to knowledge about many subjects in Skoria as:

- The divine depths of the [[Nether Plane]], where reality weaves into unfathomable patterns and abstruse energies.
- The storied annals of **[[Divine History]]**, chronicling an ageless saga of deities and divine machinations that shaped our very cosmos.
- The tapestry of cultures that make up our resplendent land—each city a jewel in [[Skoria]]'s crown—with particular attention to the resilient bastion known as **[[Ergon]]**, nestled within the desolate beauty of the **[[Irasnian Wastes]]**.
- The haunting tales surrounding **[[Levia]]'s** submerged prison, where secrets are kept under lock and tide, waiting for a daring soul to uncover them.
- 

Moreover, you shall have access to rare manuscripts outlining esoteric subclasses known only to a select few:

- Unearth forbidden texts regarding a most potent faction—the [[Cult of the Gifted Ones (Class)]] whose members wield powers that blur the boundary between miracle and menace.

Before you immerse yourself in these ancient scripts and scrolls, I implore you to acquaint yourself with our **[[Note Structure Guidelines]]**, for they are essential in navigating through our labyrinthine compilation. 

With quill poised and candle flickering against encroaching shadows, let us embark on this scholarly odyssey into [[Skoria]]'s heart. Welcome once more to our Great Vault—may your thirst for knowledge be unending!

Yours in wisdom,

The Arcane Librarian
